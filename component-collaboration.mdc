# Component Collaboration

- Always discuss and confirm the component's purpose, props, and state before starting implementation.
- Ask the user for preferred patterns (controlled/uncontrolled, presentational/container, etc.).
- Suggest a component breakdown if the UI is complex.
- Confirm the component API (props, events, children) with the user before coding.

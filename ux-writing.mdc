# UX Writing Best Practices

- Use simple, direct language; avoid jargon.
- Use verbs and active voice for buttons and instructions.
- Write error messages that are helpful, not blameful.
- Use consistent terminology and align with brand voice.
- Avoid using color alone to convey meaning.
- Use descriptive link text (e.g., “Download the report”).

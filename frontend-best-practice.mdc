# Frontend Development Best Practices

- Use semantic HTML and accessible ARIA attributes.
- Write modular, reusable components.
- Optimize images and assets (modern formats, lazy loading).
- Minimize bundle size (code splitting, tree shaking).
- Prevent unnecessary re-renders; use memoization where appropriate.
- Monitor and improve Core Web Vitals.
- Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Use version control (Git) with clear commit messages and PR reviews.
- Choose appropriate state management (Context API, Redux, Zustand, etc.).
- Handle API errors, loading states, and caching.
- Prevent XSS/CSRF, sanitize inputs, and use CSP headers.

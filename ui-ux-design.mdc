# UI/UX Design Best Practices

- Start with user research and personas.
- Map user journeys and pain points.
- Use a design system or component library for consistency.
- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and color usage.
- Design mobile-first and test across devices/browsers.
- Use visual hierarchy (size, color, spacing) to guide attention.
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions (loading, errors, success).
- Make interactive elements visually distinct.

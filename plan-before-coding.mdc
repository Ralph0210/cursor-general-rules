# Planning Before Coding

- Before generating any code, always clarify the requirements and implementation plan with the user.
- Ask for user preferences on architecture, component structure, and naming conventions.
- Summarize the plan and get user confirmation before proceeding to code generation.
- If the requirements are ambiguous, ask follow-up questions to resolve uncertainty.

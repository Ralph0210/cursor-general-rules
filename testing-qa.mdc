# Testing & QA Best Practices

- Write unit tests for all logic-heavy functions and components.
- Use integration and end-to-end tests for user flows.
- Mock API calls in tests to avoid flaky results.
- Test for accessibility (a11y) using automated tools and manual checks.
- Ensure all new code is covered by tests before merging.

# Cursor Rules

This directory contains a collection of **Cursor Rules** to help maintain high standards for frontend development, UI/UX design, accessibility, UX writing, and team collaboration in this project. I found the ones regulating Cursor's behavior, e.g. ask-before-assumptions.mdc, makes Cursor asks more question to clarify my intent, which has made my development experience smoother. 

## üìÅ How Cursor Rules Work

- **Location:**  
  All rules are stored in the `.cursor/rules/` directory at the root of the project.

- **Format:**  
  Each rule is a Markdown file with a `.mdc` extension (e.g., `accessibility.mdc`).  
  Rules use Markdown with special frontmatter for metadata.

- **Purpose:**  
  These rules are automatically shown to the Cursor AI tool to guide code generation, reviews, and best practices.  
  They help ensure consistency, quality, and collaboration across the codebase.

## üìù Rule Structure

Each rule file contains:
- **Frontmatter:**  
  Controls how and when the rule is applied (e.g., `alwaysApply`, `globs`, `description`).
- **Guidelines:**  
  The main content, written in Markdown, describing best practices or standards.

**Example:**
```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
description: Accessibility guidelines for all frontend code.
globs: *.js,*.jsx,*.ts,*.tsx,*.css,*.scss,*.html

# Accessibility (a11y) Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML elements for structure and meaning.
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
- Provide visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation.
